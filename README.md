Darks Grid Lab
===========

Darks grid is the "No Master" distributed grid compute framework. 
Darks Grid Lab is the lab version used to test some technology many years ago.
So I think you don't want to use it.

Feature
----------------

* Support map-reduce distributed compute.
* No master node, every node is independent and equality.
* Every node can execute own task on other grid node.
* It also can be used to build distributed storage.
